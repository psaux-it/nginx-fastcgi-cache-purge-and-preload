# Dummy nginx.conf for Nginx Cache Purge Preload (NPP) for WordPress
#
# Description:
# This minimal fallback configuration is used to force the plugin into "assume-Nginx" mode,
# enabling full functionality in non-standard, proxy-based or containerized  environments where Nginx
# detection would fail or nginx.conf cannot be accessed.
#
# It is activated when the following constant is defined in wp-config.php:
#
#     define('NPPP_ASSUME_NGINX', true);
#
# Preferred Approach:
# For accuracy, it is strongly recommended to bind-mount or sync the real nginx.conf
# into the WordPress (chroot/jail or container) environment as:
#
#     /etc/nginx/nginx.conf
#
# This allows the plugin to parse live configurations and detect cache paths, user directives,
# and keys correctly.
#
# Use this dummy file only as a last resort for:
# - CI testing environments
# - Systems where nginx.conf is deliberately hidden
# - Reverse-proxy setups (Apache in front of Nginx)
# - cPanel, Plesk, or managed environments with opaque service layers
