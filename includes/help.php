                        <p>This plugin is compatible exclusively with <strong>Nginx web servers</strong> running on <strong>Linux-powered</strong> systems. Additionally, the <strong>shell_exec</strong> function must be enabled and unrestricted. Consequently, the plugin may not operate fully on <strong>shared hosting</strong> environments where native <strong>Linux commands</strong> are blocked from running via PHP.</p>
                        <p>Moreover, a correctly configured PHP-FPM and Nginx setup is essential for the purge and preload operations to function properly. Otherwise, permission issues may arise.</p>
                        <p>If warnings appear or plugin settings/tabs disabled, they may indicate permission issues, an unsupported environment, or missing dependencies required for cache operations.</p>

                        <p>For the preload action to work properly, the server needs to have the <code>wget</code> command installed. The plugin uses <code>wget</code> to preload cache by fetching pages. Additionally, itâ€™s highly recommended to have the <code>cpulimit</code> command installed to manage server load effectively during the cache preloading action.</p>

                            <p><strong>Technical Background:</strong></p>
                            <p>In properly configured Nginx servers, it is not strictly necessary to have separate <code>PHP-FPM-USER</code> (as known WEBSITE-USER) and <code>WEBSERVER-USER</code> (commonly, nginx or www-data), but there are scenarios where separating these users can enhance security and performance. Hereâ€™s why:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Security:</strong> By running the PHP-FPM process under a different user than the Nginx web server, you reduce the risk of privilege escalation. If one process is compromised, the attacker does not automatically gain control over the other process.</li>
                                <li><strong>Permission Management:</strong> Having separate users allows for more granular permission settings. For example, PHP scripts can be restricted to only the directories they need to access, while the web server user can be given more restrictive permissions on other parts of the filesystem.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Separate users can help with resource management and monitoring, as it becomes easier to track resource usage per user.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The issue with <strong>Nginx cache</strong> purging often arises in environments where two distinct users are involved.</li>
                                <li>The <code>WEBSERVER-USER</code> is responsible for creating cache folders and files with strict permissions, while the <code>PHP-FPM-USER</code> handles cache purge & preload operations but lacks necessary privileges.</li>
                                <li>Even when <code>PHP-FPM-USER</code> is added to the <code>WEBSERVER-GROUP</code>, permission conflicts persist.</li>
                                <li>This is because Nginx overrides default setfacl settings, ignoring Access Control Lists (ACLs) and creating cache folders and files with strict permissions.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p>This plugin also addresses the challenge of automating cache purging and preloading in Nginx environments that involve two distinct users, <code>WEBSERVER-USER</code> and <code>PHP-FPM-USER</code>, by offering an alternative simple approach. It accomplishes this with the help of server-side tools <code>inotifywait</code> and <code>setfacl</code>.</p>

                            <h3>Tip</h3>
                            <p>Furthermore, if you're hosting multiple WordPress sites each with their own Nginx cache paths and associated PHP-FPM pool users on the same host, you'll find that deploying just one instance of this script effectively manages all WordPress instances using the NPP plugin. This streamlined approach centralizes cache management tasks, ensuring optimal efficiency and simplified maintenance throughout your server environment.</p>

                            <p>If auto-detection does not work for you, for proper matching, please ensure that your Nginx Cache Path includes the associated PHP-FPM-USER username.</p>

                            <p>For example, assuming your PHP-FPM-USER = <code>psauxit</code>, the following example <code>fastcgi_cache_path</code> naming formats will match perfectly with your PHP-FPM-USER and be detected by the script automatically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /dev/shm/fastcgi-cache-psauxit</code></li>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /dev/shm/cache-psauxit</code></li>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /dev/shm/psauxit</code></li>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /var/cache/psauxit-fastcgi</code></li>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /var/cache/website-psauxit.com</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>

                        <p>The Nginx Cache Directory option has restrictions on the paths you can use to prevent accidental deletions or harm to critical system files. By default, certain paths, like â€˜/homeâ€™ and other vital system directories, are blocked to safeguard your systemâ€™s stability and prevent data loss.</p>
                        <p>While this might limit your options, it ensures your systemâ€™s security. Recommended directories to choose from, such as â€˜/dev/shm/â€™ or â€˜/var/cache/â€™, which are commonly used for caching purposes and are generally safer.</p>

                    <div class="nppp-answer-content">
                        <p>NPP offers a more direct solution without any external NGINX module such as <strong>Cache Purge module</strong>. This plugin directly traverses the cache directory and clears cache if PHP-FPM and WEBSERVER user permissions are adjusted properly. To automate and fix these permission issues, there is a pre-made bash script that works on the server side.</p>
                        <pre><code>bash &lt;(curl -Ss https://psaux-it.github.io/install.sh)</code></pre>
                        <p>Note that NPP also supports Nginx cache preloading with a simple direct approach, with the help of <code>wget</code>. This feature is missing in other Nginx Cache plugins.</p>
                        <p>There are many cases where the external Nginx modules work fine for cache purge operations, but integrating the module with Nginx can be challenging for non-technical or regular WordPress users. Not every Linux distro packages this module or has outdated module versions, so users may need to follow extra steps to integrate it, which becomes more complicated.</p>
                        <p>Also, there are other cases where even bleeding-edge module versions are easily installed and integrated with Nginx by users, but purge operations do not work as expected. This is what I faced before and decided to develop NPP.</p>

                <h3 class="nppp-question">What is the proper PHP-FPM Nginx setup?</h3>
                <div class="nppp-answer">
                    <div class="nppp-answer-content">
                        <h3><strong>Proper PHP-FPM Nginx Setup</strong></h3>
                        <p>For a proper PHP-FPM Nginx setup, follow these steps:</p>
                        <h4><strong>PHP-FPM-USER (Website User)</strong></h4>
                        <p>The <b>PHP-FPM-USER</b> should be specifically created to run your website</p>
                        <h4><strong>WEBSERVER-USER (Web Server User)</strong></h4>
                        <p>Nginx must run with its own unprivileged user, such as <code>nginx</code> on RHEL-based systems or <code>www-data</code> on Debian-based systems.</p>
                        <h4><strong>Connecting PHP-FPM-USER and WEBSERVER-USER</strong></h4>
                        <p>Ensure that the web server user can read files belonging to the <b>PHP-FPM-GROUP</b>. Control file access via group chmod permission bits. Avoid granting additional group permissions to the <code>nginx/www-data</code> user to minimize security risks.</p>
                        <h4><strong>Set Website Content Permissions</strong></h4>
                        <p>Set the website content&#39;s group permission to <code>g=rX</code> to allow <code>nginx/www-data</code> to read all files and traverse all directories, but not write to them.</p>
                        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br />
                        Granting additional group permissions to the <code>nginx/www-data</code> user can potentially introduce security risks due to the principle of least privilege. Your <b>PHP-FPM-USER</b> should never have sudo privileges, even if it&#39;s not listed in the sudoer list, as this can still pose security drawbacks. Therefore, we will set the website content&#39;s group permission to <code>g=rX</code> so that <code>nginx/www-data</code> can read all files and traverse all directories, but not write to them.</p>

                        <pre><code>usermod -a -G PHP-FPM-GROUP WEBSERVER-USER</code></pre>
                        <p><u>Add the <b>WEBSERVER-USER</b> (such as <code>nginx/www-data</code>) to the <b>PHP-FPM-GROUP</b>, allowing the web server user to access files belonging to this group.</u></p>

                        <pre><code>chown -R PHP-FPM-USER:PHP-FPM-GROUP /home/websiteuser/websitefiles</code></pre>
                        <p><u>Set the ownership of all files under <b>/home/websiteuser/websitefiles</b> to <b>PHP-FPM-USER</b> and <b>PHP-FPM-GROUP</b>, ensuring that <b>PHP-FPM</b> can read and write these files.</u></p>

                        <pre><code>chmod -R u=rwX,g=rX,o= /home/websiteuser/websitefiles</code></pre>
                        <p><u>Set permissions for the files under <b>/home/websiteuser/websitefiles</b> so that <b>PHP-FPM-USER</b> can read and write, <b>PHP-FPM-GROUP</b> (which includes the web server user) can read, and others have no access.</u></p>

                        <h4><strong>PHP-FPM Pool Settings</strong></h4>
                        <p>Adjust PHP-FPM pool settings in the configuration file to specify the user, group, ownership, and permissions for the PHP-FPM process.</p>

                        <pre>
<code>[websiteuser.com]
user = websiteuser
group = websiteuser
listen.owner = nginx
listen.group = nginx
listen.mode = 0660
listen = /var/run/php-fcgi-websiteuser.sock</code></pre>
