                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">This WordPress plugin is compatible exclusively with Nginx web servers running on Linux-powered systems. Additionally, the <strong>shell_exec</strong> function must be enabled and unrestricted. Consequently, the plugin may not operate fully on shared hosting environments where native <strong>Linux commands</strong> are blocked from running via PHP.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">Moreover, granting the correct permissions to the PHP process owner (<strong>PHP-FPM-USER</strong>) is essential for the proper functioning of the purge and preload operations. This is necessary in isolated user environments that have two distinct user roles: the <strong>WEBSERVER-USER</strong> (nginx or www-data) and the <strong>PHP-FPM-USER</strong>.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">ðŸ“Œ If you see warnings or if any plugin settings or tabs are disabled, this could indicate permission issues, an unsupported environment, or missing dependencies that the plugin requires to function properly.</p>

                <h3 class="nppp-question">What Linux commands are required for the preload action?</h3>
                <div class="nppp-answer">
                    <div class="nppp-answer-content">
                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">For the preload action to work properly, the server must have the <code>wget</code> command installed, as the plugin uses it to preload the cache by fetching pages. Additionally, it is recommended to have the <code>cpulimit</code> command installed to effectively manage <code>wget</code> process server load during the preload action.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Technical Background:</strong></p>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px;">In properly configured Nginx servers, it is not strictly necessary to have separate <code>PHP-FPM-USER</code> (as known WEBSITE-USER) and <code>WEBSERVER-USER</code> (commonly, nginx or www-data), but there are scenarios where separating these users can enhance security and performance. Hereâ€™s why:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Security:</strong> By running the PHP-FPM process under a different user than the Nginx web server, you reduce the risk of privilege escalation. If one process is compromised, the attacker does not automatically gain control over the other process.</li>
                                <li><strong>Permission Management:</strong> Having separate users allows for more granular permission settings. For example, PHP scripts can be restricted to only the directories they need to access, while the web server user can be given more restrictive permissions on other parts of the filesystem.</li>
                                <li><strong>Resource Management:</strong> Separate users can help with resource management and monitoring, as it becomes easier to track resource usage per user.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px;"><strong>Problem Statement:</strong></p>
                            <ul>
                                <li>The issue with <strong>Nginx cache</strong> purging often arises in environments where two distinct users are involved.</li>
                                <li>The <code>WEBSERVER-USER</code> is responsible for creating cache folders and files with strict permissions, while the <code>PHP-FPM-USER</code> handles cache purge & preload operations but lacks necessary privileges.</li>
                            </ul>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px;">This plugin also addresses the challenge of automating cache purging and preloading in Nginx environments that involve two distinct users, <code>WEBSERVER-USER</code> and <code>PHP-FPM-USER</code>, by offering a pre-made bash script.</p>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3 class="nppp-question">What is the solution for the permission issues?</h3>
                <div class="nppp-answer">
                    <div class="nppp-answer-content">
                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">In environments with two distinct user roles the <strong>WEBSERVER-USER</strong> (nginx or www-data) and the <strong>PHP-FPM-USER</strong> the pre-made bash script automates the management of <strong>Nginx Cache Paths</strong>. It utilizes <strong>bindfs</strong> to create a FUSE mount of the original Nginx Cache Paths, enabling the <strong>PHP-FPM-USER</strong> to write to these directories with the necessary permissions. This approach resolves permission conflicts by granting the <strong>PHP-FPM-USER</strong> access to a new mount point, while keeping the original Nginx Cache Paths intact and synchronized.</p>

                        <p><strong>Shortly:</strong></p>
                        <ol class="nginx-list">
                            <li>Solution utilizes <strong>bindfs</strong> to create a FUSE mount of the Nginx Cache Paths.</li>
                            <li>PHP-FPM-USER is granted write access to the mount point without altering the original cache paths.</li>
                            <li>This resolves permission conflicts and enables seamless cache purge and preload operations.</li>
                            <li>Automates the task, eliminating manual configuration of permissions or file access management.</li>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3 class="nppp-question">Is there any solution to automate granting write permission to the PHP-FPM-USER?</h3>
                <div class="nppp-answer">
                    <div class="nppp-answer-content">
                        <ol class="nginx-list">
                            <pre><code>bash &lt;(curl -Ss https://psaux-it.github.io/install.sh)</code></pre>
                            <li>The <code>install.sh</code> script serves as a wrapper for executing the main <code>fastcgi_ops_root.sh</code> script from <a href="https://psaux-it.github.io">psaux-it.github.io</a>. This bash script is designed for the FastCGI Cache Purge and Preload for Nginx WordPress plugin (NPP).</li>
                            <li>The script first attempts to automatically identify the <strong>PHP-FPM-USER</strong> (also known as the PHP process owner or website user) along with their associated Nginx Cache Paths.</li>
                            <li>If it cannot automatically match the PHP-FPM-USER with their respective Nginx Cache Path, it provides an easy manual setup option using the <code>manual-configs.nginx</code> file.</li>
                            <li>According to matches this script automates the management of Nginx Cache Paths. It utilizes <strong>bindfs</strong> to create a FUSE mount of the original Nginx Cache Paths, enabling the <strong>PHP-FPM-USER</strong> to write to these directories with the necessary permissions automatically.</li>
                            <li>After the setup (whether automatic or manual) is completed, the script creates an <code>npp-wordpress</code> systemd service that can be managed from the WordPress admin dashboard under the NPP plugin <strong>STATUS</strong> tab.</li>
                            <li>Additionally, NPP users have the flexibility to manage FUSE mount and unmount operations for the original Nginx Cache Path directly from the WP admin dashboard, effectively preventing unexpected permission issues and maintaining consistent cache stability.</li>

                            <h4>Features:</h4>
                            <ul>
                                <li><strong>Automated Detection:</strong> Quickly sets up Nginx Cache Paths and associated PHP-FPM-USERS.</li>
                                <li><strong>Dynamic Configuration:</strong> Detects Nginx configuration dynamically for seamless integration.</li>
                                <li><strong>Systemd Integration:</strong> Generates and enables the <code>npp-wordpress</code> systemd service for managing FUSE mount operations.</li>
                                <li><strong>Manual Configuration Support:</strong> Allows manual configuration via the <code>manual-configs.nginx</code> file.</li>
                            </ul>

                            <h4>Tip</h4>
                            <p style="font-size: 14px;">Furthermore, if you're hosting multiple WordPress sites each with their own Nginx cache paths and associated PHP-FPM pool users on the same host, you'll find that deploying just one instance of this script effectively manages all WordPress instances using the NPP plugin. This streamlined approach centralizes cache management tasks, ensuring optimal efficiency and simplified maintenance throughout your server environment.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 14px;">If auto-detection does not work for you, for proper matching, please ensure that your Nginx Cache Path includes the associated PHP-FPM-USER username.</p>

                            <p style="font-size: 14px;">For example, assuming your PHP-FPM-USER = <code>psauxit</code>, the following example <code>fastcgi_cache_path</code> naming formats will match perfectly with your PHP-FPM-USER and be detected by the script automatically:</p>
                            <ul>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /dev/shm/fastcgi-cache-psauxit</code></li>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /dev/shm/cache-psauxit</code></li>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /dev/shm/psauxit</code></li>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /var/cache/psauxit-fastcgi</code></li>
                                <li><code>fastcgi_cache_path /var/cache/website-psauxit.com</code></li>
                            </ul>
                        </ol>
                    </div>
                </div>

                <h3 class="nppp-question">Why canâ€™t I use my preferred path for the Nginx Cache Directory?</h3>
                <div class="nppp-answer">
                    <div class="nppp-answer-content">
                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">The Nginx Cache Directory option has restrictions on the paths you can use to prevent accidental deletions or harm to critical system files. By default, certain paths, like â€˜/homeâ€™ and other vital system directories, are blocked to safeguard your systemâ€™s stability and prevent data loss.</p>
                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">While this might limit your options, it ensures your systemâ€™s security. Recommended directories to choose from, such as â€˜/dev/shm/â€™ or â€˜/var/cache/â€™, which are commonly used for caching purposes and are generally safer.</p>
                        <h4>Allowed Cache Paths:</h4>
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>For RAM-based:</strong> Use directories under <code>/dev/</code>, <code>/tmp/</code>, or <code>/var/</code>.</li>
                            <li><strong>For persistent disk:</strong> Use directories under <code>/opt/</code>.</li>
                            <li><strong>Important:</strong> Paths must be one level deeper (e.g., <code>/var/cache</code>).</li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="nppp-answer-content">
                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">When using NPP alongside other WordPress caching plugins, it's important to <strong>disable page caching</strong> in the other plugins to avoid conflicts and redundancy. They  can still be used for frontend optimizations. Here's how:</p>

                        <h4>To prevent conflicts, configure Other Caching Plugins correctly:</h4>
                        <ol class="nginx-list">
                        <ul>
                            <li><strong>While Disabling the Page Caching Feature</strong><br> Turn off the page caching option in any caching plugin you're using (e.g., WP Rocket, W3 Total Cache, LiteSpeed Cache).</li>
                            <li><strong>Keep Other Frontend Optimization Features Active</strong><br>
                                <ul>
                                    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><code>CSS/JS Optimization</code>: Minify and combine stylesheets and scripts.</p>
                                    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><code>Lazy Loading</code>: Improve page load speed by loading images and videos only when needed.</p>
                                    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><code>Database Cleanup</code>: Optimize your WordPress database to reduce bloat.</p>
                                    <p style="font-size: 14px;"><code>CDN Integration</code>: Seamlessly deliver static files from a content delivery network.</p>
                                </ul>
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                        </ol>

                        <p style="font-size: 14px;">By using NPP for server side page caching and other plugins solely for frontend optimizations, you ensure a streamlined, high-performance system without redundant caching layers and conflicts.</p>

                <h3 class="nppp-question">What is the proper PHP-FPM Nginx setup?</h3>
                <div class="nppp-answer">
                    <div class="nppp-answer-content">
                        <h3><strong>Proper PHP-FPM Nginx Setup</strong></h3>
                        <p>For a proper PHP-FPM Nginx setup, follow these steps:</p>
                        <h4><strong>PHP-FPM-USER (Website User)</strong></h4>
                        <p>The <b>PHP-FPM-USER</b> should be specifically created to run your website</p>
                        <h4><strong>WEBSERVER-USER (Web Server User)</strong></h4>
                        <p>Nginx must run with its own unprivileged user, such as <code>nginx</code> on RHEL-based systems or <code>www-data</code> on Debian-based systems.</p>
                        <h4><strong>Connecting PHP-FPM-USER and WEBSERVER-USER</strong></h4>
                        <p>Ensure that the web server user can read files belonging to the <b>PHP-FPM-GROUP</b>. Control file access via group chmod permission bits. Avoid granting additional group permissions to the <code>nginx/www-data</code> user to minimize security risks.</p>
                        <h4><strong>Set Website Content Permissions</strong></h4>
                        <p>Set the website content&#39;s group permission to <code>g=rX</code> to allow <code>nginx/www-data</code> to read all files and traverse all directories, but not write to them.</p>
                        <p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong><br />
                        Granting additional group permissions to the <code>nginx/www-data</code> user can potentially introduce security risks due to the principle of least privilege. Your <b>PHP-FPM-USER</b> should never have sudo privileges, even if it&#39;s not listed in the sudoer list, as this can still pose security drawbacks. Therefore, we will set the website content&#39;s group permission to <code>g=rX</code> so that <code>nginx/www-data</code> can read all files and traverse all directories, but not write to them.</p>

                        <pre><code>usermod -a -G PHP-FPM-GROUP WEBSERVER-USER</code></pre>
                        <p><u>Add the <b>WEBSERVER-USER</b> (such as <code>nginx/www-data</code>) to the <b>PHP-FPM-GROUP</b>, allowing the web server user to access files belonging to this group.</u></p>

                        <pre><code>chown -R PHP-FPM-USER:PHP-FPM-GROUP /home/websiteuser/websitefiles</code></pre>
                        <p><u>Set the ownership of all files under <b>/home/websiteuser/websitefiles</b> to <b>PHP-FPM-USER</b> and <b>PHP-FPM-GROUP</b>, ensuring that <b>PHP-FPM</b> can read and write these files.</u></p>

                        <pre><code>chmod -R u=rwX,g=rX,o= /home/websiteuser/websitefiles</code></pre>
                        <p><u>Set permissions for the files under <b>/home/websiteuser/websitefiles</b> so that <b>PHP-FPM-USER</b> can read and write, <b>PHP-FPM-GROUP</b> (which includes the web server user) can read, and others have no access.</u></p>

                        <h4><strong>PHP-FPM Pool Settings</strong></h4>
                        <p>Adjust PHP-FPM pool settings in the configuration file to specify the user, group, ownership, and permissions for the PHP-FPM process.</p>

                        <pre>
<code>[websiteuser.com]
user = websiteuser
group = websiteuser
listen.owner = nginx
listen.group = nginx
listen.mode = 0660
listen = /var/run/php-fcgi-websiteuser.sock</code></pre>
